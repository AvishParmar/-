# Radio-frequency-identification-RFID
The Radio-frequency-identifcation or RFID program is a replica of an emerging technology which allows for automated in-person purchases without the need for human interaction. This technology works by using sensors to automatically scan all items present in the shopping cart, or any carriage utensil the customer may be using, and drafting the amount due. This program provides a general understanding and layout of how the technology would work and its ability to bring efficiency to typical shopping experiences.
